      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>I'm Jordell Fong, a passionate cybersecurity student currently attending the University of Technology, Jamaica, while interning at a major bank corporation. This site is a reflection of my journey so far, filled with insights into my education, interests, and the things that keep me going.</p>
      <p>Technology has always fascinated me. I love understanding how things work beneath the surface, which is what initially drew me into cybersecurity. My current focus is on securing digital environments and learning how to identify vulnerabilities in systems. As part of my internship, I get hands-on experience tackling real-world cybersecurity challenges, which continues to sharpen my skills.</p>
      <p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy long drives and listening to music, which helps me unwind. Although I’m deeply involved in technology, I’m not particularly fond of coding, but I appreciate the role it plays in building secure systems.</p>
      <p>This portfolio showcases my academic achievements, professional experiences, and personal reflections. It represents my dedication to the world of cybersecurity and my commitment to making a meaningful impact in the digital world. Explore my journey, and get to know me on a deeper level—both as a professional and as an individual.</p>
